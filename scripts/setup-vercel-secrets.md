# Setting up Vercel Secrets for GitHub Actions

To enable Vercel deployment in your GitHub Actions workflow, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

## Required Secrets

1. **VERCEL_TOKEN**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
   - Create a new token with appropriate permissions
   - Copy the token value

2. **VERCEL_ORG_ID**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account)
   - Click on your organization
   - Copy the Organization ID from the URL or settings

3. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**
   - Go to your project in Vercel Dashboard
   - Go to Settings > General
   - Copy the Project ID

## How to Add Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each secret with the exact names above

## Testing the Setup

Once you've added the secrets:

1. Create a PR from your `test-actions` branch to `main`
2. The GitHub Actions should automatically run
3. You should see the following checks:
   - Lint Check
   - Type Check
   - Format Check
   - Test
   - Build Check
   - Vercel Deployment (for PRs)

## Troubleshooting

If the checks are still not running:

1. Make sure the workflow file is in the correct branch
2. Check that the PR is targeting the `main` branch
3. Verify that the workflow file is properly committed and pushed
4. Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to see if workflows are being triggered
